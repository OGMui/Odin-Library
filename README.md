# Odin-Library

## Project Overview
Odin-Library is a project developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course, specifically following the lesson on objects and object constructors. 

## Features
- **Book Management**: Users can add new books to the library. Each book instance, created using an object constructor, has properties including title, author, pages, and read status.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: The application includes a button to switch between dark and light themes. The user's preference is not stored locally, but a media query is used to check and apply the user's system preference.
- **Dialog Element**: This project also demonstrates the use of the dialog HTML element.

## Usage
To see a live demonstration please follow [this link](https://ogmui.github.io/Odin-Library/)

## Future Improvements
- **Data Persistence**: Currently, book data is not persisted and will be lost upon page refresh. Future updates will aim to include this functionality.

## Learning Outcomes
This project served as a practical application of lessons on objects and object constructors. It also provided experience with the HTML dialog element and implementing theme switching functionality.
